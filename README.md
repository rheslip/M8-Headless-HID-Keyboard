# M8 Headless HID Keyboard
 USB keyboard for the M8 Headless using a Raspberry Pi Pico. December 2023
 
 Quick and dirty USB keyboard for the Dirtywave M8 headless. Handy if you want something that feels like the real M8 keyboard. I used the actual M8 keyswitches and layout.
 
 Keycodes are configured for the M8 Web display:

 Hardware is pretty trivial - a Pico board and 8 keyswitches wired from the Pico pins to GND. See the code for Pin assignments.
